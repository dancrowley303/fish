bare minimum:
[x] hide display of cpu players
[x] show piles for each player
[x] when player fishes successfully, "show" card to other players
[x] handle case when player has no cards left
[x] handle case where you can change who you ask when you get to fish again
[x] ai for cpu players
[x] scoring at end
[x] game ends when all 13 books are won
[x] when player completes a book, gets another turn


nice to have:
order scores by points
analyze memory leaks
modularize code - break up into class structure
unit tests for each class
option for enhanced ai - cpu players can remember dealt cards, and consider when choosing targets
enhanced ai - cpu asks for cards that they already have most multiples of
graphics
multiplayer
